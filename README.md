Cycle Sense is a device that is aimed at increasing the overall safety for everyone using the road. The reality is that most drivers in the United States are not cognizant of what cyclist hand signals mean. Cycle Sense addresses this problem by recognizing these hand signals using image processing, and relaying the signal information to the automobile driver. By alerting the driver, the goal of Cycle Sense is to increase driver reaction time and mitigate cyclist-related accidents.
